# TheGamingRoom_doc
1. The Gaming Room want the mobile application and web application as well to target the both the market which is mostly in mobile that is why they also want the Mobile application as well. 
2. I will go through the entire document first then I will understand the customer requirements what customer wants or want not.
3. During mobile application development I would recoomend that first I will design the UI/UX of the mobile app which really help the customer to check the customer requirements first then show the UI/UX to the customer if customer wants the chaning, after update or customer satisfaction I will give this code to the developer team to code. or code by myself.
4. I would like to add the some diagrams on it 
5. Every time update the user requirements or also add the some recomendations to the user. 
6. I will follow the same approach which I learn in this course, first design the software design template for the user then work on it, then make the UI/UX for the developing team.
